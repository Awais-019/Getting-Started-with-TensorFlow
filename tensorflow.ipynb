    "TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It allows developers to build and train machine learning models using a data flow graph that represents computation. TensorFlow is versatile and widely used for various machine learning tasks, including computer vision and natural language processing. It also includes a high-level API called Keras for quick and easy model building and training."
