    "TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It allows developers to build and train machine learning models using a data flow graph that represents computation. TensorFlow is versatile and widely used for various machine learning tasks, including computer vision and natural language processing. It also includes a high-level API called Keras for quick and easy model building and training."

    "### 1.2 Tensors\n",
    "In machine learning and TensorFlow, a tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numerical values that represents input data, intermediate computations, and output data in a neural network. Each tensor has a data type (e.g., float32 or int64) and a shape, which defines the number of dimensions and the size of each dimension. Tensors can be created using the `tf.constant()` function and manipulated using a wide range of mathematical operations. Tensors are a critical component of machine learning and TensorFlow, providing a flexible and efficient way to represent and manipulate data in a neural network."
